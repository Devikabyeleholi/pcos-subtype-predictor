    <div class="card p-4 shadow-sm">
        <p>
            Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects millions of women worldwide. But here's the catch â€” 
            PCOS is **not one-size-fits-all**. There are multiple subtypes based on hormonal and metabolic symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application predicts your possible **PCOS subtype** using smart analysis of clinical and lifestyle data. 
            It helps guide further medical consultation and care, especially when symptoms are confusing or overlapping.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">ðŸ©º The 4 Main PCOS Subtypes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hyperandrogenic PCOS</strong> â€“ High male hormones, acne, hair loss</li>
            <li><strong>Insulin-Resistant PCOS</strong> â€“ Weight gain, sugar cravings, fatigue</li>
            <li><strong>Inflammatory PCOS</strong> â€“ Stress, bloating, headaches, chronic fatigue</li>
            <li><strong>Pill-Induced PCOS</strong> â€“ Appears after stopping birth control pills</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="mt-4"> Why This Matters</h4>
        <p>
            Early awareness of your subtype can lead to better treatment and lifestyle changes. This tool is 
            especially useful in rural or remote areas where access to specialists is limited.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4"> Project Vision</h5>
        <p>
            This is a hybrid AI solution that will later include <strong>wearable sensors</strong> and real-time monitoring. 
            But even now â€” with just clinical & lifestyle input â€” this app can make a meaningful difference.
